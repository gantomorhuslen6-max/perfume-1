# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Frontend is Ready for Vercel Deployment!

### 🔧 **Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` to use `rootDirectory: "front-end"`
- ✅ Simplified build commands (no more `cd` commands)
- ✅ Created `.vercelignore` to exclude backend files
- ✅ Verified build process works locally

### 📋 **Vercel Configuration:**

#### `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "rootDirectory": "front-end"
}
```

#### `.vercelignore`:
```
backend/
ADMIN_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
*.md
.git/
.gitignore
```

### 🌐 **Environment Variables:**
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

### 🚀 **Deployment Steps:**

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel**
2. **Set the root directory to `front-end`** in Vercel settings
3. **Add environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Deploy!**

### 🔗 **API Configuration:**
The frontend is already configured to use:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:3001` (when backend is running locally)
- **Production**: `https://perfume-900a.onrender.com` (your backend URL)

### ✅ **Build Status:**
- ✅ Dependencies install successfully
- ✅ Build process completes without errors
- ✅ All pages generate correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**
- Static pages will be pre-rendered
- Dynamic API routes will work at runtime
- About content will load from your backend API
- Authentication will work with your backend

### 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**
- If build fails, check that `rootDirectory` is set to `front-end`
- Ensure environment variables are properly set
- Verify your backend is deployed and accessible
- Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

### 📊 **Performance:**
- Next.js 16 with Turbopack for fast builds
- Static generation for optimal performance
- Automatic image optimization
- Built-in caching and CDN

Your frontend is now ready for Vercel deployment! 🎉
